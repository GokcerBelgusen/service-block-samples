# Spring Cloud Function Service Block Samples

This repository contains a collection of service block examples that will help you learn how to use Spring Cloud Function in your microservice architecture.

## What are Service Blocks?

Service blocks are cloud-native applications that share many characteristics with microservices. The key difference with microservices is that a service block is a self-contained system that has multiple independently deployable unitsâ€”mixing together serverless functions with containers.

While microservices can be created entirely as serverless functions, a service block focuses on a contextual model that combines together traditional "always-on" applications with portable on-demand functions.

## Usage

This repository contains a collection of experimental sample projects that demonstrate the service block patterns. Check the README of each service block in this repository to see the status of the project.
